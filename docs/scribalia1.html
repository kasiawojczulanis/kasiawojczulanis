<p>#PhD is not a hobby, it is a work.</p>
<p>I think it was Confucius (and my quick check upon the Internet confirms it), who said<strong>:</strong> “Find a job you love and you will never have to work a day”. I like this sentence and I think I get it’s philosophical meaning but I also find it bit misleading. It tells only about a bright side of the job, while there is no just one(bright)-side job on this planet. Actually, even beyond the planet. The moon, for example, from the Earth perspective only the bright side is visible but there is a dark one, for sure. Same with any project. There is ALWAYS, both bright side, which you will be attracted by and you may love it, and dark one, which may haunt you and eat you, if you ignore it.</p>
<p>For most of people, and especially PhD students just starting their journey, PhD project seems like the job of dreams. People doing their PhD pursuit answers they always wanted to know and while doing so, they work in quite magic environment (lab/field), being surrounded by books and knowledgeable people. Modern technology, only helps with the research, allowing to reach what is unachievable by regular human standards. All this is true for most of the projects, the only wrinkle is that there is also other stuff associated with every project, much less notable and convenient, which you have to handle if you want to complete the project. For example, a fieldwork may be a big challenge (when you collect your samples in, euphemistically speaking, unfavourable weather conditions), but if it is your favourite part (and weather is not so nasty all the time), you enjoy it, and it does not feel like a job. But then, you need to analyse the data and report them (i.e.&nbsp;write papers) otherwise your effort in the field does not matter. If data analysis or reporting is not your cup of tea, you are going to suffer. If you suffer too much, perhaps PhD project is not for you. If you suffer a little, it is understandable, nobody likes everything about their project. Still, you just need to eat this frog (or rather many frogs), and eat it quickly (before it eats you)…so you can go to the field again, with a new project.</p>
<p>PhD project is not a hobby. A hobby stuff you do in a free time and only if you are in a mode for doing it. PhD is a work, with all its ups and downs. To complete it and get all the fruits out of it (knowledge, skills, satisfaction, degree, and more research opportunities) you need to go through both. You also need to treat it seriously. If you do not work honestly (let’s say 40 hours per week) you will lose your motivation and fail with completing the project, and probably fail with your future plans.</p>
<p>If you can efficiently handle less pleasant parts of your job, your PhD, it will be a dream job for you. So, just do what is to be done, and take the energy from the most enjoyable parts!</p>
<p>#Read, read and once again read.</p>
<p>It is well established that reading is a meta-capability that not only maintains our brain functions (e.g., concentration) but also increases our knowledge and intelligence. This is important in everybody’s life but if you aspire to get PhD you need to outperform an average reader. You need to read proper scientific literature and you need to read a lot of it. This is because to perform your study, and perform it well, you need a lot of knowledge and creative and critical thinking. Those can be only developed through regular reading.</p>
<p>When you write your manuscripts, especially the introductory and discussion parts, you definitely need to refer to scientific literature. This naturally forces you to read papers because you need to cite them. However, reading papers when you are already at the writing stage is not sufficient. Being in writing mode you are most likely to be just screening the papers for the information you need, and so you will not gain much of it, just citation. The best would be if you had read these papers much before, and at the time of writing you went back to them, to get your citation. Obviously, there would be papers which you did not know, found only while looking for a supporting reference, but they should constitute rather minority of your reference list.</p>
<p>The best reading strategy is that you read every day, let’s say for an hour. You need to make a habit of it, so plan the reading a paper daily. If you read one-two papers every day, over the five days of a working week you will read them 5-10. Then, while reading the paper, read it as a whole item, not just a single section you are the most interested in. Read the intro, read the methods, read results and discussion. Then, think of the results and interpretation, think of the idea of the study, trying to figure out what you do like and what do you dislike about the study. If you can share these thoughts with your colleagues during a seminar or lunch break is even better (and you have a topic for a small talk). This all will help you to memorize the content, and develop critical thinking. I would also add, read sections like: acknowledgments and authors contribution, so you will get some insight into a logistical know-how of the study. Either you use a Zotero, Mendeley or whatever app to read the articles, or you read them in paper, make notes. Even if the notes turned out to be not useful after all, they will help you to consciously process the content.</p>
<p>Regular reading papers will make a true expert of you, and will help you to move your project forward and move it smoothly, so you will have a fun of it. We think that motivation comes from inside. It does, but the motivation has to be constantly fed properly from outside otherwise it starves and at some point diminishes into thin air. Regular papers reading does the job. It keeps you updated with the current literature and so motivated and enthusiastic about scientific endeavours. In other words, your scientific performance very much depends on your enthusiasm but your enthusiasm depends on your performance. It is circular and, to keep this vicious circle running, you need external stimulation.</p>
<p>Last tip, to make the reading a daily routine, as I said before, you need to make a habit of it. And as experts on personal development recommend, you need a strategy to create a habit: a small dosage at the beginning, progressively increased, with the routine being associated with a pleasure. So, you can start with the reading planned twice a week (not a big deal after all, right?), you do the reading first thing at the morning (so it does not compete with your other, maybe urgent tasks; urgent tasks are powerful time managers) and you do it in a deep learning mode (no emails, no phone calls, no message, literally no distractors, just you and your paper). A cup of coffee (or a tea) accompanying the session will not hurt.</p>
<p>Regular reading scientific literature will not hurt you, it will empower you!</p>
<p>#Chunkilization</p>
<p>If you just check this word in a dictionary and could not find it is because I made it up. What does it mean, you will soon figure out. Let me start with a little story: At Polish Polar Station in Hornsund (Svalbard), where I have been working for twenty years, there used to be dogs, a Greenland breed. They were supposed to bark at approaching polar bears, so to alarm the people about the presence of the big guy. How efficient the system was it is disputable but this story is not about the polar bear protection, it is about enthusiasm and the size of challenge. The dogs were apparently well fed as the rate and amount of food was carefully calculated by veterinarians and they looked healthy but they were ALWAYS in a mood to eat more. They were super excited when the food was on the way, quickly consuming what they got, and just after looking forward to the next meal. Once upon a time, they crept into a warehouse where their food supplies for half a year were stored. Nobody could see them entering so it is hard to say how enthusiastic there were at the moment but when they left, two days later, they did not want to eat at all! Surprisingly, given their enthusiasm about the food, and the time they spent in the warehouse, they have not eaten all the supplies. What is the conclusion of the story? There are two. First, dogs enthusiasm about the food ended with the food over-dosage. Second, despite enormous enthusiasm, they could not eat all at once.</p>
<p>I would not like to say that PhD students and their projects are like the polar dogs and their food but it is a good metaphor for the PhD students enthusiasm and the challenge which PhD project imposes. At the beginning everybody is super excited, which is understandable and great. At some point, however, and this moment will come for sure, especially after a hard-working period, one is fed up with everything, no matter how great the project is. Then, PhD project is a big endeavour, and cannot be done with a single approach.</p>
<p>This fluctuation of the enthusiasm and motivation about a project, including PhD, is not just my observation, it is actually well recognized psychological phenomena. The highest level of the motivation about a project (let’s from now focus on the motivation, which is more relevant here while not exactly the same as enthusiasm) are at the beginning, then just before the end of the project. In between the motivation drops, to fluctuate at a lower level. Sometimes the level drops considerably, and one should do their best to stay above a critical line, to keep the project running. It is important to be aware of these fluctuations. They are natural. If we feel tired with the project it does not mean the project is bad or we do not fit to the project. It is just a natural human way of dealing with a project which lasts for a longer period of time. With every longer lasting project we sometimes simply get bored and tired. No matter what the project is about, what was our initial enthusiasm and what is our performance in the project. There will be some days, sometimes weeks we will feel overwhelmed. What is important, and we have to carefully watch for, is that our motivation does not drop below the critical line, and the periods of the low motivation are not months-lasting.</p>
<p>There are many ways to keep ourselves motivated and prevent falling into a valley of a scientific death. One of them is dividing your project into small chunks. You cannot eat all at once, you need to divide the supplies into small portion. What is a unit of chunk? Well, it depends on your appetite, stomach size and what your vet recommends 😉, but basically you divide it until manageable pieces. PhD project is a single, big chunk, if you refer to your all the projects in your life time. For sure, it has to be split. So you can split it into chapters, papers you are going to write. Those are still too big, to make each at once, but each consists of several sections. They can also be chunks. Sometimes these sections are still are too big to handle them at once, so you can think of each paragraph in the section as a chunk, and this would be probably the limit of your ‘chunkilisation’ (with a philosophical approach you could probably go with this into infinity). A paragraph (probably more than one) is something you can definitely handle during a working day. Make it as a plan for the day and just do it!</p>
<p>If you reasonably divide your project into chunks, and you work on them consistently, your project will move forward regardless of the motivation. Besides, retrospectively looking on your performance you will motivate yourself. Seeing how much you have already done, will drag your motivation up and so you will never reach the critical line.</p>
