"*In order to see birds it is necessary to become a part of the silence*" \[Ys\]

I am behavioural ecologist, with a wide range of scientific interests and research on various animals species (see \[Projects\] (projects.qmd) and \[Publications\] (publications.qmd). However, my special focus is on breeding ecology and reproductive behaviours (now particularly coordintion of parental performance at any level) and most of my studies I do on birds, with polar seabirds being my favorite group (*Alle alle uber alles*).
