I am behavioural ecologist, with a wide range of scientific interests and research on various animals species (see Projects and Publications). However, my special interest is reproductive behaviour and most of my studies I do on birds, with polar seabirds being my favorite group.

**Keywords** that would "profile me" right now (it changes)? - behavioural ecologist, R enthusiast (probabaly never a master), Yuki' kahu
