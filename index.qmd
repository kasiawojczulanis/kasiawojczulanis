I am behavioural ecologist, with a wide range of scientific interests and research on various animals species (see Projects and Publications). However, my special focus is on breeding ecology and reproductive behaviours (now particularly coordintion of parental performance at any level) and most of my studies I do on birds, with polar seabirds being my favorite group (*Alle alle uber alles*).

"*In order to see birds it is necessary to become a part of the silence*" \[Ys\]
